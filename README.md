# Key Learnings from ACME Software Company Cybersecurity Risk Assessment

## Overview

This project focused on identifying and assessing potential cyber threats to ACME Software Company, a fictitious small business. The key learnings from this exercise include understanding how to prioritize cybersecurity risks, evaluate threat-asset pairings, and apply risk management principles in a practical setting.

## Key Learnings

1. **Importance of Cybersecurity in Small Businesses**
   - Small businesses, like ACME Software Company, are often vulnerable to cyber threats due to limited security measures. This project highlights the need for even small companies to implement cybersecurity protocols.

2. **Understanding the CIA Model**
   - The project utilizes the **CIA model** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) to evaluate risks. Each potential threat to ACMEâ€™s assets was assessed based on how it could impact these three core elements of security.

3. **Risk Assessment through Likelihood and Impact**
   - A critical part of the exercise was estimating the **likelihood** of a cyber attack and the **consequences** if it occurred. This methodology helps in prioritizing which risks should be addressed first.

4. **Threat-Asset Matrix**
   - The **Threat-Asset Matrix** serves as a structured way to analyze the potential risks to different assets within a company. Students learn how to map threats to specific assets and assess their relative importance.

5. **Justifying Risk Prioritization**
   - A key learning is the ability to **justify risk prioritization** based on both probability and impact. Students were encouraged to think critically about why certain risks are more pressing than others, using the analogy of spilled coffee vs. engine explosion.

6. **Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation**
   - The project provides insights into the need for developing a **cybersecurity program**. The importance of using a structured, thoughtful approach to security planning is emphasized throughout.

7. **Self-Learning Opportunities**
   - Students are encouraged to further explore best practices in **threat-asset risk management** through additional resources, offering a chance for deeper learning.

## Conclusion

This project reinforces the importance of cyber risk assessment in business operations, especially for small companies. By evaluating the potential risks through the CIA model, students gain practical insights into how cybersecurity strategies are developed and implemented.
